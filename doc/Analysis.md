# Analysis 

## Robosub 2015 Downfall
1. Classification of objects under poor conditions 
2. Fail to assign probablity to partially occluded object 
3. Non-uniform illumination and underwater caustics for bottom tasks 
4. Fail to make use of prior knowledge about the task
5. Difficult to distinguish object purely on color when needed 
6. Lack of multiple strategies for each task
7. Did not stress algorithms enough during pool test
