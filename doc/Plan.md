## Developing an expertise in Object Tracking for Autonomous Systems
Autonomous systems are increasingly more prominent with increase in computing power and 
more novel algorithms that enables the robot to make decision intelligently. Object tracking
remains one of the most important task for an autonomous system such as scanning underwater 
gas pipeline, surveillance, self-driving car etc. A good tracking algorithm exploits domain
specific knowledge to improve efficiency;therefore, this research mainly focuses on underwater
application of object tracking.

### Long-term goals
- [ ] fully-integrated multiple object tracking algorithm with ROS(Robotics Operating System)
- [ ] robust single object tracking algorithm under perturbed conditions

### Short-term goals
- [ ] simple object recognition under various conditions
 - [ ] varying illumination conditions
 - [ ] occlusion 
 - [ ] shadow 
- [ ] multiple simple object recognitions under various conditions
- [ ] integrate vision processing module with ROS (Robotics Operating System) 

### Plans
1. Enroll in online courses
