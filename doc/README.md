## Aim 
1. Single Object Tracking
- matching
  - region -> uses object template(global information) and similarity measure i.e mean shift  
  - feature -> uses local information involves feature extraction and feature matching 
  - deformable template -> uses contour that is highly elastic for tracking but sensitive to initialization 
  - model -> uses geometric model 
- filtering
  - kalman 
  - particle 
- class -> regard as classification btw background and foreground
- fusion
  - multi-feature
  - multi-algorithm
  - multi-model 
2. Multiple Object Classification 
3. Saliency Region Detection 
4. Underwater Image Recovery 
5. Justifying background subtraction 
6. Using power of context and semantics
7. Hybrid between global and local. Offline and online
