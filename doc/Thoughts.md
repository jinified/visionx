# A New Approach 

## Key vision ideas
- combining multiple algorithms or features generally yield better result 
- using prior information to advantage through Bayesian Filtering 
- exploit temporal cues such as optical flow or other motion detector 
- using probabilistic model instead of binary values. focus on soft detection 
- ensemble methods and cascade style detection is very efficient 
- add usage of features and templates as part of algorithm

## Localization ideas
- using pixel area based distance estimation 
- record previous movements for easy backtrack
